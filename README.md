# Heart_Disease
The Heart Disease UCI Dataset contains various medical and demographic features to help predict the presence or absence of heart disease in patients. The target indicates whether a patient has heart disease or not .
Problem Definition

The problem we are trying to solve is predicting the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various clinical and demographic features. Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. By analyzing patient data, including age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators, we aim to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient is likely to have heart disease.
Why Machine Learning is the Best Solution

Machine learning (ML) is well-suited for this problem for several reasons:

    Complex Relationships: Heart disease prediction involves many variables (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) that have complex interrelationships. Machine learning algorithms can effectively model these non-linear relationships, capturing patterns that may not be immediately apparent to human analysts.

    Improved Accuracy: Traditional rule-based systems for diagnosing heart disease often lack flexibility and fail to generalize well to new data. Machine learning models, especially when trained on large and diverse datasets, have been shown to outperform traditional methods in accuracy and reliability.

    Real-Time Predictions: Once trained, machine learning models can provide quick predictions based on new patient data, making them highly useful in real-world clinical settings where time is crucial.

    Continuous Improvement: ML models can be updated and retrained as new data becomes available, improving over time and adapting to new insights and trends in heart disease research.

    Automated Decision Support: ML-based solutions can serve as decision support systems for healthcare professionals, helping them make more informed decisions by providing data-driven insights.

Dataset Information

For this project, we will use the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset is widely used for research in the field of heart disease prediction and provides a reliable and standardized benchmark for evaluating machine learning models.

    Dataset Name: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset
    Location: UCI Machine Learning Repository
    URL: Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data  

Features in the Dataset

The dataset consists of 14 attributes (features), which include:

    age: Age of the patient
    sex: Sex of the patient (1 = male; 0 = female)
    cp: Chest pain type (1 to 4)
    trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
    chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
    fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
    restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2)
    thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
    exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
    oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
    slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 to 3)
    ca: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy
    thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
    target: Presence of heart disease (1 = disease; 0 = no disease)

Using this dataset and machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) I can build a predictive model that will help in identifying the risk of heart disease in patients. This can be a valuable tool in preventive healthcare and early diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
